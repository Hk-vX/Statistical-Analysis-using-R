# ðŸŽ“ Student Debt Analysis: Unveiling Financial Burdens in Higher Education ðŸ’¸

This project investigates the impact of academic program types, credential levels, and institutional characteristics on student debt using U.S. College Scorecard data. Through the lens of Maya, an education policy analyst passionate about equity in higher education, the study explores patterns in student loan burdens and provides data-driven insights to aid students, institutions, and policymakers.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives

- Identify key variables that influence student loan amounts  
- Compare average debt levels across degree types and fields of study  
- Assess how credential levels (Associate, Bachelor, etc.) impact debt  
- Analyze whether program size or institution type affects borrowing  
- Model and forecast student debt outcomes using statistical methods
