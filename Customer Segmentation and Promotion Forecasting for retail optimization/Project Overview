This project applies customer analytics and machine learning in R to improve the marketing and inventory strategies of Nata Supermarkets, a mid-sized Canadian retail chain. Using three years of customer data, we:

- Segment customers based on purchasing behavior.
- Predict their responsiveness to promotions.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives 

- Use K-Means Clustering for customer segmentation.
- Apply Random Forest and Logistic Regression to predict promotional response.
- Generate insights to enhance marketing efficiency, inventory planning, and customer satisfaction.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description

- Collected by Nata Supermarkets (2012â€“2014), the dataset includes:
- Demographics: Age, Income, Education, Marital Status, Dependents
- Transactions: Spending by product category (e.g., Wine, Fish), Purchase Frequency, Coupon Usage
- Promotional Response: Response (Yes/No) to past promotions

Preprocessing in R:
- Missing value imputation (tidyr, dplyr)
- Encoding categorical features
- Normalizing spending variables (scale)
- Removing duplicates and outliers

ðŸ§  Methodology
1. Customer Segmentation
- Algorithm: K-Means Clustering
- Goal: Identify key customer types (e.g., price-sensitive, loyal, premium)

2. Promotion Response Modeling
- Algorithms: randomForest, glm
- Performance:
Accuracy: 85.37%
Sensitivity: 95.74%
Specificity: 26.26%

ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Three distinct segments: budget-conscious, loyal, and premium shoppers
- Moderate spenders were most responsive to personalized promotions
- Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression in classification balance
- Custom promotions increased overall campaign effectiveness

ðŸ“Œ Business Implications
- Enables targeted, cost-efficient marketing campaigns
- Improves inventory accuracy by anticipating demand
- Increases customer retention through personalization

ðŸ”® Future Directions
- Integrate real-time transaction tracking
- Use advanced ML models like xgboost or keras for deeper insights
- Include external variables like seasonality and economic conditions
