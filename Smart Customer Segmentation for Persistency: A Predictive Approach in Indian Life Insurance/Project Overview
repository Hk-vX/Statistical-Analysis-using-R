This project presents a real-world data analytics and modeling case study focused on improving customer persistency (retention) in the Indian life insurance sector. Photon Life Insurance (PLI), in collaboration with Concentrix Corporation (CNX), used predictive modeling to identify at-risk policyholders and design a targeted contact strategy to reduce policy lapses.

üîç Objectives
- Analyze factors affecting customer retention and policy lapse.
- Build a logistic regression model to predict lapse probability.
- Segment customers into risk tiers (High, Medium, Low).
- Develop a contact strategy based on customer risk.
- Quantify the business impact in terms of improved persistency and reduced operational cost.

üß∞ Tools & Technologies
- Programming Language: R
- Statistical Techniques: Logistic Regression, ROC Curve, AUC Score
- Data Visualization: ggplot2
- Data Handling: dplyr
- Deployment: RMarkdown

üìà Key Findings
- Over 2.3 million policyholders analyzed.
- Predictive model accurately identified high-risk segments.
- Resulted in 10% improvement in customer persistency.
- Better resource allocation between internal and external contact centers.
