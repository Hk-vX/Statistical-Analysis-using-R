This project explores how geographic and temporal factors influence global agricultural commodity prices, using data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The narrative follows Sofia, a data-savvy agricultural economist, as she investigates regional disparities and temporal patterns in producer prices to support farmers and policymakers.

ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives

- Analyze the effect of geographic region on commodity values
- Examine temporal trends in agricultural prices over multiple years
- Model the combined influence of region and time using regression
- Identify price extremes across countries and possible underlying causes
- Evaluate whether statistical models can help forecast commodity prices

ðŸ›  Key Features
- Web scraping implementation (with rvest) to automate data collection from the FAO website
- Data cleaning and outlier filtering for robust analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using ggplot2 and dplyr
- Regional and temporal comparisons via descriptive statistics and boxplots
- Support for dynamic storytelling through RMarkdown narrative blending data science and human context

ðŸ“¦ R Libraries Used

- rvest, xml2, httr: For web scraping
- dplyr, tidyr, stringr: Data manipulation
- ggplot2, scales, forcats, RColorBrewer: Visualization
- broom, corrplot: Statistical modeling support
- readr: Reading/writing CSV files

ðŸ’¡ Use Cases

- Academic research on agricultural economics
- Policy formulation and subsidy allocation
- Educational storytelling with real-world data
- Community empowerment through data-driven insights
